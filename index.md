Hi, I'm an incoming PhD student at Michigan State University in Fall this year! 

I work on Bayesian Statistics, Machine Learning, and Automated Reasoning. Sometimes I try to use Category Theory to try to understand Formal Learning Theory better. I'm interested in exploring formal reasoning through LLMs, specifically formal verification of code generated by LLMs and ensuring soundness.
