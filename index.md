Hi, I'm a grad student at Carnegie Mellon University. 

I work on Bayesian Statistics and Machine Learning. Sometimes I try to use Category Theory to try to understand Learning Theory better. I'm interested in exploring formal reasoning through LLMs, specifically formal verification of code generated by LLMs and ensuring soundness. 

I'm on the job market starting summer 2025.
